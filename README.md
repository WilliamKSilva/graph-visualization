# Info
This is a function Graph visualization, we currently have three available, you can change between then on the Graph GameObject settings of the inspector:
- Sine Wave 
- Multi Sine Wave 
- Ripple Wave 

This project has two versions of the same Shader that are used to make the Graph colorful:
  - The first is the PointSurface.shader, that makes use of the Default Unity render pipeline, built directly with shader language code
  - The second is the PointURP.shadergraph, that makes use of the Universal Render Pipeline, built using shader graph (a graphical solution to build shaders on Unity editor).
